# Logic_Gates
ModelSim is a simulation tool widely used for verifying digital circuits, including logic gates, through hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL. It allows users to design and simulate logic gates by writing code that specifies the gate's behavior. Logic gates, such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR, are fundamental components in digital circuits, each performing specific operations on binary inputs to produce an output.

In ModelSim, you can implement logic gates by writing Verilog or VHDL code. For example, a simple AND gate can be written in Verilog as `assign Y = A & B;`, where `A` and `B` are inputs, and `Y` is the output. To simulate the behavior of the gate, you create a testbench, a separate module that provides input combinations and observes the output. This helps in verifying if the logic gate behaves as expected for all possible input states.

ModelSim's powerful debugging and simulation tools allow you to visualize waveforms and examine the logicâ€™s performance in real-time, making it an essential tool for digital design verification.
